              The Stella Mary’s - Seed Money Scheme (SM-SMS), offered by Stella Mary’s College of Engineering, has the primary goal of fostering research and innovation among both faculty and students. This scheme provides seed funding to initiate or sustain research endeavours. Its primary objective is to enhance the chances of securing future financial support from external organizations. Applicants are required to effectively showcase that their proposed project introduces a novel research trajectory with the potential to attract external funding. Projects already backed by alternative funding sources will not be eligible for consideration.
